# VIRTUAL_PAINT_OPENCV
This Python project uses OpenCV to create a virtual paint application that tracks colored objects via webcam and allows users to draw on the screen in real-time. It detects specific colors and contours, mapping them to brush strokes, and displays the result on the video feed.
